## 3. THREE PILLARS OF VISION

Separate from D.O.T.S consulting — these represent the FUTURE ZeroOne is building.

### Pillar 1: AI Without Internet 🔐 (Lavender)
- **Status:** Vision/Building (honest about this)
- **Concept:** AI on YOUR device. No cloud. No subscriptions. ₹0 forever.
- **Jio Analogy:** "Like Jio democratized mobile internet for 1.4B Indians, local AI democratizes intelligence."
- **Tech:** Ollama + Open WebUI + Llama 3 + Stable Diffusion

### Pillar 2: AI Council 🧠 (Mint)
- **Status:** CRACKED — used actively 2+ months
- **Concept:** 5-6 AI models debating your problems like a board of directors
- Cross-reference financials, creative, operations, hiring → unified recommendation

### Pillar 3: AI Office 🏢 (Peach)
- **Status:** CRACKED — actively building
- **Concept:** One manager AI (Claude Opus 4.6) orchestrating specialist AIs
- Can spin up 100 agents instantly for parallel execution
- One prompt → Full campaign: copy + visuals + video + landing page + email

### Combined Power
AI Without Internet + AI Council + AI Office = The entire back-office of the future.
